{-| This module contains the primitives to build, update and traverse graphs.
If you find that this module is hard to use or the documentation
is insufficient, consider opening an issue for that (and possibly even a
pull request :)).

Internally, we use the `elm-intdict` package for efficient dynamic graph
representation.

{-| The central graph type. It is parameterized both over the node label type `n`
and the edge label type `e`.

One can build such a graph with the primitives under *Build*. Most of the time
`fromNodesAndEdges` works fairly well.

For simplicity, this library just uses a patricia trie based graph representation, which means
it is just an efficient version of `Dict NodeId (NodeContext n e)`. This allows efficient insertion and
removal of nodes of the graph after building.

{-| Analogous to `Dict.update`, `update nodeId updater graph` will find
the node context of the node with id `nodeId` in `graph`. It will then call `updater`
with `Just` that node context if that node was found and `Nothing`
otherwise. `updater` can then return `Just` an updated node context
(modifying edges is also permitted!) or delete the node by returning
`Nothing`. The updated `graph` is returned.

This is the most powerful building function since all possible per-node
operations are possible (node removal, insertion and updating of context
properties).

The other operations can be implemented in terms of `update` like this:

    remove nodeId graph =
      update nodeId (always Nothing) graph
    insert nodeContext graph =
      update nodeContext.node.id (always (Just nodeContext)) graph

{-| Analogous to `Dict.insert`, `insert nodeContext graph` inserts a fresh node
with its context (label, id and edges) into `graph`. If there was already a node
with the same id, it will be replaced by the new node context.

    graph1 = fromNodesAndEdges [Node 1 "1"] []
    newNode =
      { node = Node 2 "2"

      , outgoing = IntDict.empty
      }

It's possible to build up whole graphs this way, but a lot less tedious way would
be simply to use `fromNodesAndEdges`.

without a node with id `nodeId`. If there was no node with that id, then remove
is a no-op:

    graph = fromNodesAndEdges [Node 1 "1", Node 2 "2"] [Edge 1 2 ()]

there is a node with id `nodeId` in `graph`.

    member 42 graph == False
    member 1 graph == True
-}
member : NodeId -> Graph n e -> Bool
member nodeId =
  Focus.get graphRep >> IntDict.member nodeId


{-| Analogous to `Dict.get`, `get nodeId graph` returns the `Just` the node
context with id `nodeId` in `graph` if there is one and `Nothing` otherwise.

    graph = fromNodesAndEdges [Node 1 "1", Node 2 "2"] []
    get 42 graph == Nothing

otherwise.

This is useful for finding unoccupied node ids without trial and error.

and a `label`) in `graph`.

    edges empty == []
    graph = fromNodesAndEdges [Node 1 "1", Node 2 "2"] [Edge 1 2 "->"]

  in
    foldl' prependEdges (unGraph graph) []


{-| `fromNodesAndEdges nodes edges` constructs a graph from the supplied `nodes`
and `edges`. This is the most comfortable way to construct a graph as a whole.
Oftentimes it is even more convenient to use `fromNodeLabelsAndEdgePairs` when
edges are unlabeled anyway and auto incremented node ids are OK.

The following constructs a graph with 2 nodes with a string label, connected
by an edge labeled "->".

    graph = fromNodesAndEdges [Node 1 "1", Node 2 "2"] [Edge 1 2 "->"]

      Graph (List.foldl addEdge nodeRep edges)


{-| A more convenient version of `fromNodesAndEdges`, when edges are unlabeled
and there are no special requirements on node ids.

`fromNodeLabelsAndEdgePairs labels edges` implicitly assigns node ids according
to the label's index in `labels` and the list of edge pairs is converted to
unlabeled `Edge`s.

    graph = fromNodeLabelsAndEdgePairs ['a', 'b'] [(0, 1)]

{-|  `nodeById nodeId` focuses on the node with id `nodeId` with a `Graph`.
Since the node might or might not exist, the small part on which we focus wraps
the `NodeContext` in a `Maybe`.

This is a combination of the `get` and `update` functions which is handy for
composition of foci deep into a graph. Unfortunately, we need a combinator which
would get rid of the `Maybe` wrapping (that would be the task of a prism I think),
but suppose we have something like `Focus.withDefault : a -> Focus (Maybe a) a`,
then we could define

    ctx = NodeContext (Node 2 "2") IntDict.empty IntDict.empty
    focus = nodeById 2 => Focus.withDefault ctx => node => label
    graph = fromNodesAndEdges [Node 1 "1", Node 2 "2"] [Edge 1 2 "->"]
    graph1 = Focus.set focus graph "="

for each node context `ctx`.

`edgeMerger` resolves conflicts for when there are already edges in both
directions, e.g. the graph isn't truly directed. It is guaranteed that
`edgeMerger` will only be called with the smaller node id passed in first
to enforce consitency of merging decisions.

{-| A node visitor specialized for depth-first traversal. Along with the node
context of the currently visited node, the current accumulated value is passed.
The visitor then has the chance to both modify the value at discovery of the
node through the first return value and also provide a finishing
transformation which is called with the value after all children were processed
and the node is about to be finished.

In the cases where you don't need access to the value both at dicovery and at
finish, look into `onDiscovery` and `onFinish`.

holds always that `length path == distance - 1`).
